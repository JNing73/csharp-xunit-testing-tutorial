C# xUnit Testing Tutorial

This is a record of my coding follow along of training content from 
Pluralsight.com

The base code was all written by the course creator Thomas Claudius Huber
(https://www.thomasclaudiushuber.com). Any commits I have made or will make
will be identical or with the same intent as what was demonstrated by Thomas in
the course content.

## Coding Concepts Demonstrated

- Setting up an xUnit test project
- Creating test classes
- Creating tests methods which utilise Assert functions
- Assertions on Exceptions (Including exception messages)
- Setting up a data driven test
- Use dependency injection to decouple dependencies to assist in unit testing
- Setting up common common code to run before each test
- Setup code to run at the end of each test via IDisposable
- Specifically decouple console dependency by using a TextWriter interface
- Applying test driven development principles
- Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline which builds and runs the tests
  on commits to main branch.
